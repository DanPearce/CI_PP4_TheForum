theforum is exacty what it says it is on the tin, a website designed for any and whatever topics our users would like to discuss! The site is deliberately left as a broad discussion board, to attract just about anyone who has something to say.

Users are able to create their own ForumPost, comment on any post, and create their own ForumBoard. This allows the users to have a free discussion on their chosen topic.
